# Stages — migration progress log

A running log of what shipped in each session. Newest first.

## Phase 2 — Checkpoint A: foundation (2026-05-07)

**Goal:** lay TypeScript / lib / primitives groundwork without changing visible behavior.

**What landed:**
- `src/types/stages.ts` — full type set mirroring prototype shapes.
- `src/lib/{constants,format,buildStages,storage}.ts` — utilities + `window.storage` in-memory stub.
- `src/components/icons/{StagesLogo,WorkspaceIcon,StatIcons}.tsx`.
- `src/components/{Avatar,Toast}.tsx`.
- `src/app/globals.css` — `@layer components` ported from the prototype's `<GlobalStyles>` (`panel-card`, `btn-primary`, `btn-ghost`, `icon-btn`, `field`, `check-box`, `stage-node`, etc.).
- `src/app/page.tsx` — uses imported `StagesLogo` instead of inlining.

**Verified:** Hello-stages page renders identically (logo, wordmark, tagline, dotted grid, footer). No console errors.

**Phase 3 schema decisions locked** during checkpoint review — see [CLAUDE.md → Phase 3 schema decisions](CLAUDE.md). Seven flags surfaced from the prototype, all answered: drop owner columns, drop legacy `messages[]`, single `stage_notes` shape, mentions as `user_id`, multi-owner workspaces, all inline arrays become tables, normalized `read_state`.

**Pending for Checkpoint D — client portal:**
- **Add a Files section to `ClientPortal`.** The prototype has no receiving view for files the agency marked `clientVisible`. Surface them in the portal:
  - All `clientVisible` items from `pipeline.links` plus all `clientVisible` items from `stage.attachments` across every stage.
  - Sort newest-first. Image thumbnails. Stage-attachment items show the colored stage badge (same component the agency-side rolled-up Files tab uses).
  - Click an image to open the existing lightbox modal.
  - Read-only — no upload, no toggle, no delete.
  - Surface as a third tab next to Project / Chat, OR as a section below the project journey — pick whichever feels cleaner during implementation.

## Phase 1 — Skeleton (2026-05-07)

**Goal:** working Next.js scaffold deployed locally, on-brand, pushed to GitHub.

**Stack chosen:**
- Next.js 16.2.6 (App Router, `--no-turbopack` for predictability during migration)
- React 19.2.4
- TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind v4 (CSS-based config via `@theme inline` in `globals.css`)
- lucide-react for icons
- Plus Jakarta Sans via `next/font/google` (replaces Geist)
- npm

**What landed:**
- Project scaffolded at `./stages/` with `create-next-app`. The prototype `Client Workspaces.jsx` stays at the parent dir as the source of truth.
- Brand palette wired up as Tailwind v4 theme tokens (`text-stages-text`, `bg-stages-bg`, etc.) — full set of colors ported from the prototype's `GlobalStyles`.
- Plus Jakarta Sans loaded via `next/font` with weights 400/500/600/700/800.
- Hello-Stages landing page rendering on `localhost:3000` — logo, wordmark, tagline, dotted-grid backdrop.
- `CLAUDE.md` written as the cross-session project memory; `AGENTS.md` (auto-generated, contains a Next 16 warning) preserved and imported from CLAUDE.md.
- Git repo initialized (auto by `create-next-app`), Phase 1 changes committed locally on `main`. Remote `origin` set to `https://github.com/jperez203-coder/stages.git` (HTTPS). **Push to GitHub is pending — local machine has no GitHub credential helper configured yet; once a PAT is set up, `git push -u origin main` will complete the phase.**

**Verified:** dev server starts clean on port 3000, page renders with correct font/colors. Brand palette utilities (`bg-stages-bg`, `text-stages-blue`, `dotted-grid`, etc.) confirmed in compiled CSS.

**Open items / flagged for later phases:**
- Prototype's full `GlobalStyles` utility class set (`panel-card`, `btn-primary`, `btn-ghost`, `icon-btn`, `field`, `check-box`, `stage-node`, etc.) NOT yet ported — they'll come over in Phase 2 alongside the components that use them.
- `StagesLogo` is currently inlined in `page.tsx`; will move to `src/components/StagesLogo.tsx` in Phase 2 alongside the rest of the component split.

**Next session — Phase 2:** refactor the monolithic JSX into module structure (`/components`, `/hooks`, `/lib`, `/types`). Get the prototype rendering identically to the artifact, still on a stub in-memory store.
